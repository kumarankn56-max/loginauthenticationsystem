Styling with Tailwind CSS.

Basic authentication logic (e.g., login, logout, session/token management).

Clean project architecture to serve as a starting point.


Features

User login form with validation

Password hashing and secure handling (to be implemented or extended)

Session or token-based auth support

Responsive UI styled with Tailwind CSS

TypeScript for type safety

Configured with Vite for fast development build and hot-reload


Tech Stack

Frontend: Vite + TypeScript

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Build tools: Eslint, PostCSS

Configuration: tsconfig, vite.config.ts

HTML/JS/TS/HTML5

(Backend not included — this can be extended with Node.js/Express, or any other backend as needed)


Getting Started

Prerequisites

Node.js (v16 or later)

npm or yarn


Installation

git clone https://github.com/kumarankn56-max/loginauthenticationsystem.git  
cd loginauthenticationsystem  
npm install

Running Locally

npm run dev

This will start the local development server with hot-reload enabled.

Building for Production

npm run build

Previewing Production Build

npm run preview

Usage

1. Open the app in your browser (typically at http://localhost:3000).


2. Use the login form to enter a username/email and password.


3. The auth logic (placeholder) will check credentials and respond accordingly.


4. After login, a protected area or token-based state can be managed.


5. You can log out to clear the session/token.



> ⚠️ Note: This is a foundational demo. For production use you’ll want to integrate a backend, secure token storage (e.g., HttpOnly cookies or secure local storage), encryption, multi-factor auth, and other best practices.
